# Paper Reading Journal üìö

This repository is a curated journal of research papers I have read in **machine learning theory, mathematics, and 
related areas**. 
Each entry distills the key contributions, mathematical foundations, and personal insights I gained 
from the paper. The goal is to maintain a structured record of my learning process which can also function as a reference
or a quick go-to guide for someone new in the field.

# Initialization
